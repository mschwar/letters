The Universal House of Justice

Department of the Secretariat

27 June 2012

To all National Spiritual Assemblies

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

The Universal House of Justice has directed us to inform you that the announcement in its Riḍván 2012 message regarding the raising up of two national and five local Ma

sh

riqu’l-A

dh

kárs has been greeted with expressions of joy and excitement from across the world and that contributions are already being made to the Temples Fund. Alongside this outpouring of enthusiasm, the House of Justice was particularly touched to receive intimations that the believers in Iran are very eager to be allowed to contribute to this Fund.

The House of Justice considers that at this time any such material offering from the Bahá’ís in Iran risks being misrepresented by the enemies of the Faith and could become a cause of fresh injury to the members of this already sorely tried community. Therefore, it is best that they continue to expend their resources for the betterment of their society and the financial support of their community. Yet, the yearning of these steadfast believers to promote the interests of the Cause and provide for its needs worldwide should not be left unanswered. The House of Justice has, accordingly, decided to contribute five million dollars to the Temples Fund on their behalf.

With loving Bahá’í greetings,

Department of the Secretariat
