The Universal House of Justice

6 August 1984

The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

We are requested by the Universal House of Justice to thank you for your letter of 10 July 1984 recounting the electrifying events which took place at the closing session of your last National Convention. The House of Justice was deeply moved to learn of the enthusiastic response that the delegates and others present made to the inspiring talk given by the Hand of the Cause of God Zikrullah Khadem, and by their desire, expressed on the scroll which you have forwarded to the World Center, for the Law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh to be applied to all believers in the United States.

In response to this petition the Universal House of Justice has decided that, although it is not yet timely to apply this mighty law in the West, it will send to the believers in the United States and other Western countries a translation into English of a compilation of texts so that they will be able to familiarize themselves with this subject. This translation is now being prepared and when it is complete an appropriate announcement will be made which will constitute the first step in the process of applying this law of God to the Western Bahá’í communities.

Kindly share this letter with the friends in your area of jurisdiction.

With loving Bahá’í greetings,

Department of the Secretariat
