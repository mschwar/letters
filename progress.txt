========================================
CURRENT STATUS SNAPSHOT
========================================
Phase: 2 (File & Pipeline Core)
Branch: main
Overall Progress: 30%

Done:
- [x] Canonical docs reviewed and merged.
- [x] Phase 0: Initialize repo structure and baseline files.
- [x] Phase 1: Backend foundation (FastAPI bootstrap, schema + migrations, auth scaffold, seeding hooks).
- [x] Phase 2: Storage + ingestion core (hashing, ULID, original archiving, ingestion event/run tracking).

In Progress:
- [ ] None.

Next:
- [ ] Run Alembic migrations to initialize `data/db.sqlite`.
- [ ] Seed default owner + taxonomy.
- [ ] Expand pipeline steps (extract/convert/index/link).
- [ ] Add role-based guards and integration tests.

Blocked:
- [ ] Dependency installation blocked (no network access to fetch pinned packages).

FEATURE LOG (append-only)
========================================
[2026-02-07] Feature: Phase 1 Backend Foundation
- Scope reference: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 1; BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md schema; PERSISTANT.md rules
- What was built:
  - FastAPI app skeleton with `/health` and `/api/v1/auth` endpoints.
  - Structured logging + config loader.
  - SQLAlchemy models matching canonical schema.
  - Alembic migration `0001_initial` (includes FTS5 virtual table).
  - Seed defaults helper + optional startup seeding.
  - Unit tests for health + security helpers.
- Tests added/updated:
  - `apps/api/tests/test_health.py`
  - `apps/api/tests/test_security.py`
- Result:
  - NOT RUN (dependencies not installed in this environment).
- Known gaps:
  - DB migrations not executed yet; `data/db.sqlite` still empty.
  - Auth role guards not enforced beyond `/me` dependency.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - Run `alembic upgrade head` and seed defaults.
  - Add role-based guards and integration tests.

[2026-02-07] Feature: Phase 2 File & Pipeline Core (baseline)
- Scope reference: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 2; BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md storage rules
- What was built:
  - Worker config + storage service (deterministic paths, immutable originals).
  - SHA-256 hashing utility.
  - ULID generator (Crockford base32).
  - Ingestion repository helpers (events, runs, steps).
  - CLI ingest flow: hash -> dedupe -> archive.
- Tests added/updated:
  - `apps/worker/tests/test_hashing.py`
  - `apps/worker/tests/test_ulid.py`
- Result:
  - NOT RUN (dependencies not installed in this environment).
- Known gaps:
  - Migrations not executed; ingestion will fail until DB initialized.
  - Pipeline steps beyond archive are stubbed.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - Run migrations + seed defaults.
  - Extend pipeline steps and add integration tests.
