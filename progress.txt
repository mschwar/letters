========================================
[2026-02-07] Feature: Phase 1 Backend Foundation
- Scope reference: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 1; BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md schema; PERSISTANT.md rules
- What was built:
  - FastAPI app skeleton with `/health` and `/api/v1/auth` endpoints.
  - Structured logging + config loader.
  - SQLAlchemy models matching canonical schema.
  - Alembic migration `0001_initial` (includes FTS5 virtual table).
  - Seed defaults helper + optional startup seeding.
  - Unit tests for health + security helpers.
- Tests added/updated:
  - `apps/api/tests/test_health.py`
  - `apps/api/tests/test_security.py`
- Result:
  - NOT RUN (dependencies not installed in this environment).
- Known gaps:
  - DB migrations not executed yet; `data/db.sqlite` still empty.
  - Auth role guards not enforced beyond `/me` dependency.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - Run `alembic upgrade head` and seed defaults.
  - Add role-based guards and integration tests.
